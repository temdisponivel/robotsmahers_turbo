Wrecking Bots

Brief
Players compete online in robot combat in a no-holds-barred cage match to the death. Robots are created by players using a component system that allows for constructive creativity. Players design their own Chassis, and then attach either their own created components, or those designed by the community to create the combat robot of their dreams.

Gameplay
Players compete against one another in The Arena. They the challenge of other player’s bots, as well as environmental obstacles. To win a match players must immobilize their opponent(s) in 2 out of 3 rounds per match. They can do so by either destroying their opponent’s means of traversal, or doing enough total damage to the bot that it shuts down.

Creating a Bot
The Bot Creator is an in-game bot editor which allows players to update their bot loadouts in client. Players can create chassis and components.
The chassis controls both the general shape, and its weight(size) controls the number of attachment points available for a player place.
Components control the functionality of the bot. They include things like weapons, locomotion, defensive plating, etc.
Components can be placed in any available attachment slots, some components require multiple slots.
After a player designs their bot, they must win one match against a basic AI opponent before being allowed to use their bot in PvP matches. This is to keep the quality of bots limited to those that will actually function in a match. 

The Map
There will be a few predefined created by developers to seed the ranked play mode, however after the game is up and running, players will be able to create their own maps using assets provided to them by Bossa. 

Controls
Players can map their controls to attachment points as they see fit, but default gamepad controls are as follows:
LS - Bot Movement
RS - Bot Rotation
A - Attachment 1
B - Attachment 2
X - Attachment 3
Y - Attachment 4
RB - Attachment 5
LB - Attachment 6
RT - Attachment 7
LT - Attachment 8
If a component takes up multiple attachment points, it can be activated by any button related to that component.

Aesthetic
The game should reflect the brutal, combative nature of the fights. The fake audience should look battered and bloodthirsty; constantly egged on by the disembodied voice of the Master of Ceremonies - a character only ever heard and not seen.
